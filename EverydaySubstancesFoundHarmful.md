**Practically every item manufacturered in 2019 will be considered unsafe to handle by 2119.**

In the same way we today are scared of small amounts of mercury, lead, and asbestos found in historic artifacts, in the future substances we use to manufacture goods will be found to be similarly harmful.

Some of those substances will be found to be harmful in the parts-per-billion range, and due to non-perfect manufacturing and refining in use today, pretty much any item will be found to have unacceptable concentrations of at least one harmful substance.
