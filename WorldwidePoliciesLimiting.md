The creation of worldwide standards or policies will eventually hold humanity back.

For example, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights is enforced as almost-law in most countries around the world.

While many things it contains are widely seen today as a good idea, it is possible that *better* ideas and regulations exist which conflict.

If there were no worldwide law, it would be possible for one country or region to try a better set of rules, and, if it really were better, lead to better economic growth, more worldwide influence, and eventually spreading that idea to other territories, either through diplomacy or force.

That mechanism becomes almost a 'survival of the fittest' of governments, laws, cultures, etc.   The downfall of nearly every historic civilisation can be linked to weaknesses in these areas compared to other countries.

As soon as a global law is put in place, that particular area of rules no longer contributes to 'survival of the fittest', and as such, rate of discovery of improvements will decrease.

Some might contend that thinking alone can contribute to better laws (for example, through the will of the people/leaders to put new laws in place that they see as a good idea), but my claim is that beyond a certain point 'demonstrating economic success' and 'experts think this will lead to economic success' won't correlate much anymore.  The thought process that goes into designing laws is as much a part of the fitness metric as the law itself.
