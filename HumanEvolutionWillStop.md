Humans will stop their own evolution, and this will be a major contributor to their downfall.
============================================================================================


People have long tried to reduce disease and suffering.  One cause of disease and suffering is genetic mutations.   Today we see certain genetic traits selected against in IVF clinics.  In the future, techniques like this will be extended and expanded on to ensure there are zero genetic mutations in offspring (since the chances of a mutation being disadvantagous are so much larger than an advantagous mutation).

This means humans will end up mixing existing genetics, but never gaining new traits.  This will stunt humans from a biological perspective.
