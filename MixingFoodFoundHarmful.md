Foodstuffs which are safe and wholesome will be found to be less lafe and wholesome after they have been mixed together with other food of the same type.

# Why?
In any food product, a small percentage of the product will be *bad* in some way.  Such badness will be found to have minor negative health effects *irrespective of dosage* (ie. a higher dose of the bad element of the food will not make the negative health effects much worse).

# Example

Imagine 1 in 1 million cows have a bacterial/viral/prion disease.  The disease, if transmitted, causes (for example) a slightly heightened cancer risk.   Such risk factor is not easily detected today, since it is small and occurs perhaps decades after infection, if at all.

If a farmer raises his own cows for him and his family, then perhaps in a lifetime, he will eat meat from 500 cows.  His chance of getting the disease is 0.05%

If someone else buys processed meat which is made by grinding cow meat from thousands of cows together and putting it in a pie, and they eat a few pies per week, then they might eat meat from 10 million cows over a lifetime, making the chance of contracting the disease practically certain.

If there are many different types of bacterial/viral/prion diseases with similar incidence rates, then the minor negative health effects will sum to become significant for most people.

# How will this be discovered?

I believe these risk factors will only be found by large amounts of data mining of medical records etc.

# When will this be discovered?

Evidence will slowly grow, but only be taken seriously ~2080.  I believe privacy protections around use of private data will prevent finding good evidence to shape human behaviour sooner.
