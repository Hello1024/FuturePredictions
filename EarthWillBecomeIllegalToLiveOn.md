**One day, nobody will be allowed to live on earth**

If humanity ever expands to new planets, pressure to preserve the environment of earth will get ever stronger.  To begin with, major polluters (mining, manufacturing, etc.) will be forced to move to other planets by environmental regulations.  Eventually, a minority of humans will live on Earth, and inter-planet tourism will become significant.  Efforts to 'restore' earths environment will get stronger and stronger (with minimal success), but one side effect is people will be restricted from doing lots of things on Earth, and over time, populations will dwindle to only the tourism industry.  Eventually, all visits will be for a few hours or days only, for 'research' or 'conservation' purposes only, with nobody living on the planet, a little like Antarctica is today.

# When?

~300 years after the first million people live off Earth.
